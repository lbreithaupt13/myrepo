A systematic review of international guidelines was undertaken to help identify key elements of existing models of follow-up care to establish a theoretical basis for evaluating future complex interventions. Many guidelines provide insufficient information to judge the reliability of the recommendations. Although the PSA test remains the cornerstone of follow-up, the diversity of recommendations on the provision of follow-up care reflects the current lack of research evidence on which to base firm conclusions. The review highlights the importance of transparent guideline development procedures and the need for robust primary research to inform future evidence-based models of follow-up care for men with prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {Population declines of pollinators constitute a major concern for the fate of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in a context of global change. Massive declines of pollinator populations driven by habitat loss, pollution, and climate change have been reported, whose consequences at community and ecosystem levels remain elusive. We conducted a mathematical modeling and computer simulation study to assess the dynamic consequences of pollinator declines for the biodiversity of plants and pollinators. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of increased mortality and decreased carrying capacity of specialist vs. generalist and effective vs. ineffective pollinators visiting specialist vs. generalist plants on long-term community biomass and species persistence. Our results reveal that increased larval mortality and increased competition for space among larvae had the greatest impacts on the decline of pollinator diversity. In contrast, the largest sustained decreases in pollinator biomass were driven by increased adult mortality in spite of a small increase in pollinator species persistence. Decreased pollinator diversity led in turn to decreased plant diversity. Attacking pollinators with high degree and connected mostly to low-degree plants produced the greatest losses of plant diversity. Pollinator effectiveness had no noticeable effect on persistence. Our results illuminate our understanding of the consequences of pollinator declines for the maintenance of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The pollination of flowering plants by animals represents a critical ecosystem service of great value to humanity, both monetary and otherwise. However, the need for active conservation of pollination interactions is only now being appreciated. Pollination systems are under increasing threat from anthropogenic sources, including fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, modern agricultural practices, use of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and invasions of non-native plants and animals. Honeybees, which themselves are non-native pollinators on most continents, and which may harm native bees and other pollinators, are nonetheless critically important for crop pollination. Recent declines in honeybee numbers in the United States and Europe bring home the importance of healthy pollination systems, and the need to further develop native bees and other animals as crop pollinators. The “pollination crisis” that is evident in declines of honeybees and native bees, and in damage to webs of plant-pollinator interaction, may be ameliorated not only by cultivation of a diversity of crop pollinators, but also by changes in habitat use and agricultural practices, species reintroductions and removals, and other means. In addition, ecologists must redouble efforts to study basic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions if optimal management decisions are to be made for conservation of these interactions in natural and agricultural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Ephemeral pools occur worldwide, provide habitat for organisms with a variety of life history strategies, and may have served as evolutionary refugia for some taxa since Mesozoic times. Yet, our understanding of the ecology and evolutionary history of ephemeral pool communities is hampered by a paucity of such basic data as the species composition of pool assemblages. We surveyed 58 vernal (ephemeral spring-time) pools from 14 sites in northern California for crustaceans, and found diverse assemblages composed largely of endemic and rare species. Sixty-seven species of crustaceans were found, and as many as 30 of these may be new, undescribed species. Differences in species composition among pools correspond with physical and chemical aspects of the habitat (depth, solutes concentration, elevation, biogeographic region), and with existing geologic/floristic-based habitat descriptions. Species richness is positively correlated with both depth and surface area. This relationship can be explained in terms of hydroperiod (accommodation of species with slower developmental rates in long-lived pools, greater time for temporal resource partitioning) and size (spatial habitat heterogeneity). High species richness and numerous co-occurrences of congeneric species in temporary pools may be due to super-abundant resources, low levels of predation, and annual truncation of the community which prevents ecological interactions from going to completion. The results of this survey underscore the need for conservation of the vernal pool habitat and endemic vernal pool species in California. The best preservation strategy will include many pools at each site, multiple sites of each habitat type, and all identified habitat types.},

	abstract = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67\% to 96\% but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78\% in temperate-zone communities to 94\% in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5\% of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant–pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems.},

	title = {Characterization and global distribution of vernal pools},
	abstract = {We define vernal pools as precipitation-filled seasonal wetlands inundated during periods when temperature is sufficient for plant growth, followed by a brief waterlogged-terrestrial stage and culminating in extreme desiccating soil conditions of extended duration. These factors have played a significant selective role in shaping the vernal pool flora and fauna. Inundation during the growing season largely eliminates establishment of upland species in the pool basins and the terrestrial period is sufficiently desiccating to prevent establishment of many typical wetland taxa. Pool filling is predomi-nantly from precipitation and drainage is from a relatively small watershed, consequently nutrient input is largely autog-enous. Vernal pools tend towards oligotrophic and are poorly buffered with dramatic diel changes in CO 2 , O 2 , and pH. These factors have played a role in selection of CAM photosynthesis in Isoëtes and Crassula, and may further contribute to elimination of many other typical wetland plants. The flora comprises two elements: cosmopolitan aquatic taxa and vernal pool specialists. The former are species in genera found worldwide in aquatic habitats, whereas specialists are species from terrestrial genera in western North America. While the fauna includes vernal pool endemics, most all species are in globally widespread aquatic genera. California vernal pools comprise a diverse array of seasonally aquatic habitats. Although variable in their origin, size, shape, type of duripan, depth, duration of inundation and species composition, three factors (duration, timing, and source of inundation) are common across all systems generally classified as Californian vernal pools. Outside of California, vernal pools are present in other Mediterranean climate regions, being best developed in Chile and Western Australia. Vernal pools are also found in non-Mediterranean climates, for example on the well-studied "granite outcrops" of the southeastern U.S., where shallow basins fill during the winter and, despite summer-rains, high tempera-tures and shallow substrates result in desiccating summer conditions. Other seasonal wetlands such as desert playas, Great Plains buffalo wallows and prairie playas or potholes have sufficient differences to be excluded by our definition of a vernal pool.},

	abstract = {To examine competition for pollination in a natural community, I measured pollinator sharing, pollinator dependence, and limitation of fruit set for four colflowering shrub species in The Great Swamp, Rhode Island. These species included all potential competitors for pollination and have had the long, extensive associations deemed necessary for competitive coevolution. The four shrubs shared the major pollinators (bees), and three of the four species depended upon pollinators for fruit set; but pollination limitation due to competition was detected in only one species. Despite the lack of competition, the shrubs interacted negatively and stronly for bumble bees, which were major pollinators. The species differentially attracted bumble bees, and their relative attractive (competitive) abilities were predicted by an index based on average daily sucrose production per flower x local floral density as: Ilex opaca {\textgreater} Kalmia latifolia {\textgreater} Gaylussacia frondosa {\textgreater} Kalmia angustifolia. Bumble bees rarely visited the less attractive species during flowering overlap in 3 of 4 yr. Competitive avoidance was achieved, not by specialization and divergence as is commonly hypothesized, but by having traits that confer tolerance of rare pollinator visits (e.g., long-lived flowers or self-pollination) or by having diverse pollinator assemblages (small bees and bumble bees). K. latifolia was the only shrub specialized for pollination (by bumble bees), and this specialization increased, rather than decreased, the risk of pollination limitation because K. latifolia was a poorer competitor for bumble bees than Ilex. Pollination limitation was prevented or reduced by the extended longevity of unpolinated flowers. Flowers could remain viable {\textgreater} 2 wk until Ilex ceased flowering and bumble bees switched to K. latifolia K. angustifolia, the poorest competitor, was visited by many species of small bees and could also self-pollinate, so fruit set was maintained even in the absence of bumble bees, Gaylussacia lacked these traits, and it was pollination limited: flowers are short-lived and cannot self-pollinate. For this species small bees were important in maintaining fruit set when bumble bees switched to more attractive species. These traits for competitive avoidance are advantageous when pollination is uncertain for any reason, such as unfavorable weather for pollinator foraging. As a result, their presence cannot be unambiguously attributed to past competition, although they currently are important in reducing competition among these shrubs. Such traits as generalization for resource use of tolerance of sparse resources may be as important as specialization or greater competitive ability for the coexistence of species in competitive communities.},

	abstract = {Premise of research. Pollen limitation may affect the potential for plants to set a full complement of seeds, persist in a community, and influence floral evolution. The level of pollen limitation experienced by a population may be influenced by the phenology of the pollinator and coflowering plant community. Methodology. In this study, I used pollen supplementation to test for pollen limitation throughout a season in a population of insect-pollinated, vernal pool annuals, Limnanthes douglasii rosea. I collected information on the phenological changes in pollinator-sharing, coflowering community members and pollinator community composition in three flowering seasons to investigate the potential impacts of community composition on pollen limitation. Last, I investigated components of pollen transfer that may impact pollen limitation: pollen loads found on pollinator bodies and pollen found on stigmatic surfaces after visitation. Pivotal results. I found that L. d. rosea experiences significant pollen limitation during the early season when evaluated over the entire flowering season and that the level of pollen limitation is related to changes in the coflowering community and changes in the pollinator community. The effects of coflowering community and pollinator community composition are also correlated with seasonality. Both components of pollen transfer are positively associated with greater abundances of L. d. rosea and coflowering community member Lasthenia spp. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that pollen limitation can change throughout a season and that pollen limitation and factors that affect the extent of pollen limitation are influenced by community context.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity offers critical insights into the ecological dynamics shaping species composition and ecosystem function, thereby informing conservation strategies. Despite its recognized importance in ecosystem management, the assessment of phylogenetic diversity in endangered habitats, such as vernal pools, remains limited. Vernal pools, characterized by cyclical inundation and unique plant communities, present an ideal system for investigating the interplay between ecological factors and phylogenetic structure. This study aims to characterize the phylogenetic patterns of vernal pools and their associated vegetation zones, addressing questions about taxonomic and phylogenetic community discreteness, the role of flooding as a habitat filter, the influence of invasive species on phylogenetic structure, and the impact of seasonal variation on phylogenetic diversity. I find that zones-of-vegetation exhibit high between zone taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity whereas each zone forms a unique cluster, suggesting that zones are taxonomically and phylogenetically discrete units. Regions of high-inundation pressure exhibit phylogenetic clustering, indicating that flooding is a habitat filter in vernal pool habitats. Competition between native species conform to the ‘competitive relatedness hypothesis’ and, conversely, communities dominated by invasive Eurasian grass species are phylogenetically clustered. In addition, I find that phylogenetic diversity within zones fluctuates across the spring season in response to changing water levels, precipitation, and temperature. By analyzing three pools within the Merced Vernal Pool and Grassland Reserve, this research elucidates the phylogenetic dynamics of vernal pools. The findings underscore the need for tailored conservation strategies that account for the unique ecological characteristics of each vegetation zone within vernal pool habitats.},

	abstract = {While native populations are often adapted to historical biotic and abiotic conditions at their home site, populations from other locations in the range may be better adapted to current conditions due to changing climates or extreme conditions in a single year. We examine whether local populations of a widespread species maintain a relative advantage over distant populations that have evolved at sites better matching the current climate. Specifically, we grew lines derived from low- and high-elevation annual populations in California and Oregon of the common monkeyflower (Erythranthe guttata) and conducted phenotypic selection analyses in low- and high-elevation common gardens in Oregon to examine relative fitness and the traits mediating relative fitness. Californian low-elevation populations have the highest relative fitness at the low-elevation site, and Californian high-elevation populations have the highest relative fitness at the high-elevation site. Relative fitness differences are mediated by selection for properly timed transitions to flowering, with selection favoring more rapid growth rates at the low-elevation site and greater vegetative biomass prior to flowering at the high-elevation site. Fitness advantages for Californian plants occur despite incurring higher herbivory at both sites than the native Oregonian plants. Our findings suggest that a lag in adaptation causes maladaptation in extreme years that may be more prevalent in future climates, but local populations still have high growth rates and thus are not yet threatened.},

	abstract = {Environmental gradients can drive adaptive evolutionary shifts in plant resource allocation among growth, reproduction, and herbivore resistance. However, few studies have attempted to connect these adaptations to underlying physiological and genetic mechanisms. Here, we evaluate potential mechanisms responsible for a coordinated locally adaptive shift between growth, reproduction, and herbivore defense in the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus. Through manipulative laboratory experiments, we found that gibberellin (GA) growth hormones may play a role in the developmental divergence between perennial and annual ecotypes of M. guttatus. Further, we detected an interaction between a locally adaptive chromosomal inversion, DIV1, and GA addition. This finding is consistent with the inversion contributing to the evolutionary divergence between inland annual and coastal perennial ecotypes by reducing GA biosynthesis/activity in perennials. Finally, we found evidence that the DIV1 inversion is partially responsible for a coordinated shift in the divergence of growth, reproduction, and herbivore resistance traits between coastal perennial and inland annual M. guttatus. The inversion has already been established to have a substantial impact on the life-history shift between long-term growth and rapid reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the DIV1 inversion also has sizable impacts on both the total abundance and composition of phytochemical compounds involved in herbivore resistance.},

	abstract = {1. Pollination by insects is a key ecosystem service and important to wider ecosystem function. Most species-level pollination networks studied have a generalised structure, with plants having several potential pollinators, and pollinators in turn visiting a number of different plant species. This is in apparent contrast to a plant's need for efficient conspecific pollen transfer. 2. The aim of this study was to investigate the structure of pollen transport networks at three levels of biological hierarchy: community, species and individual. We did this using hoverflies in the genus Eristalis, a key group of non-Hymenopteran pollinators. 3. We constructed pollen transport networks using DNA metabarcoding to identify pollen. We captured hoverflies in conservation grasslands in west Wales, UK, removed external pollen loads, sequenced the pollen DNA on the Illumina MiSeq platform using the standard plant barcode rbcL, and matched sequences using a pre-existing plant DNA barcode reference library. 4. We found that Eristalis hoverflies transport pollen from 65 plant taxa, more than previously appreciated. Networks were generalised at the site and species level, suggesting some degree of functional redundancy, and were more generalised in late summer compared to early summer. In contrast, pollen transport at the individual level showed some degree of specialisation. Hoverflies defined as "single-plant visitors" varied from 40\% of those captured in early summer to 24\% in late summer. Individual hoverflies became more generalised in late summer, possibly in response to an increase in floral resources. Rubus fruticosus agg. and Succisa pratensis were key plant species for hoverflies at our sites 5. Our results contribute to resolving the apparent paradox of how generalised pollinator networks can provide efficient pollination to plant species. Generalised hoverfly pollen transport networks may result from a varied range of short-term specialised feeding bouts by individual insects. The generalisation and functional redundancy of Eristalis pollen transport networks may increase the stability of the pollination service they deliver.},

Although mostly based on mitochondrial DNA, the increasing availability of genomic sequences is leading to unprecedented levels of resolution. Temporal studies of population genetics have revealed dynamic patterns of change in many large vertebrates, featuring localized extinctions, migrations, and population bottlenecks. The pronounced climate cycles of the Late Pleistocene have played a key role, reducing the taxonomic and genetic diversity of many taxa and shaping modern populations. Importantly, the complex series of events revealed by ancient DNA data is seldom reflected in current biogeographic patterns. DNA preserved in ancient sediments and coprolites has been used to characterize a range of paleoenvironments and reconstruct functional relationships in paleoecological systems. In the near future, genome-level surveys of ancient populations will play an increasingly important role in revealing, calibrating, and testing evolutionary processes.},
